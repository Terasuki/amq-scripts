# AMQ Scripts
Tampermonkey scripts for [AMQ](animemusicquiz.com).

Currently, only **AMQ Instance Tracker** is available.

## Instance Tracker 

Tracks your correct and missed guesses for the selected instance, saving them on localStorage. Also provides additional stats such as guess rate.

Further testing still required, use at your own risk.

Basic functionality is provided via chat commands.

**.t <instance>**: selects an instance or creates a new one if it does not exist.

**.s**: prints to chat loaded instance results.

**.p**: stops the script.
