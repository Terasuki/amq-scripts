# AMQ Scripts
Tampermonkey scripts for [AMQ](https://animemusicquiz.com/). I made the scripts here to help me automate statistic recording I did manually; expect bad coding/practices as I never coded an app nor used JavaScript/HTML/CSS before, thanks to other userscripts for helping me. Feedback appreciated.

Use them at your own risk. You can contact me thorugh Discord (terasuki) or through AMQ's website itself (TrueXC).

## Song List Auto Download

Automatically downloads the lastest game's JSON file from the song list. 

## Ranked Tracker

This script tracks some statistics about your current performance, this is aimed to be more useful in Ranked, though by default works in all rooms. It tracks:
- Guess rates by song type.
- Your current top percent in the room.
- The points needed to reach certain milestones in the room (Top 50%, 20%, 5%, and top 3 overall).
- Song distribution by difficulty and type. This is aimed towards Novice ranked, with the total amount per type/difficulty marked in brackets.
